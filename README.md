# Feed Reading Testing

In this project a web-based application that reads RSS feeds required a test suite I had to complete.

## Test 1 
Define feed.

## Test 2 
It loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

## Test 3
It loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

## Test 4
It ensures the menu element is hidden by default. 

## Test 5
It ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.

## Test 6
It ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
   
## Test 7
It ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
